# Prediction-of-fire-based-on-meterological-data
Problem Statement:</br > 
Forest fire is a disaster that causes economic and ecological damage and human life threat. Thus predicting such critical environmental issue is essential to mitigate this threat. The Algerian Forest Fire dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria. There are 122 instances for each region and the instances are recorded for the period from June 2012 to September 2012.
The dataset includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class)</br > 

Goal:</br > 
In this challenge, you must build a predictive model using Decision Tree classifier that is able to predict fire based on the meteorological data corresponding to the critical weather elements that influence the forest fire occurrence, namely temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, etc
